# TO-DO-Localstorage

notes on elements functions APIs etc

* In JavaScript, localStorage is a built-in web API that allows you to store data in the browser—persistently. That means the data stays saved even after the browser is closed and reopened.
It works like a simple key-value store, where both the key and value must be strings. Here's a quick breakdown:
 Common Methods
- localStorage.setItem(key, value) – Save data
- localStorage.getItem(key) – Retrieve data
- localStorage.removeItem(key) – Delete a specific item
- localStorage.clear() – Wipe everything

* The setAttribute() method in JavaScript is a powerful way to modify HTML elements dynamically. It allows you to set any valid attribute on an element, and if the attribute doesn’t exist, it creates it.

li.setAttribute('data-id', task.id)
