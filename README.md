# TO-DO-Localstorage

notes 

In JavaScript, localStorage is a built-in web API that allows you to store data in the browser—persistently. That means the data stays saved even after the browser is closed and reopened.
It works like a simple key-value store, where both the key and value must be strings. Here's a quick breakdown:
 Common Methods
- localStorage.setItem(key, value) – Save data
- localStorage.getItem(key) – Retrieve data
- localStorage.removeItem(key) – Delete a specific item
- localStorage.clear() – Wipe everything
